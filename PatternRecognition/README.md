# Pattern Recognition

## Process
    0. It is called at the middle of Pose Estimation Process


    1. Input : the nodes' position info(x, y, z) from Pose Estimation Process


    2. Calculate angles between certain nodes' position info
        - by the cosin second's rule : when known the three lengths of a triangle
        - by the inverse cosin func : convert value(-1 ~ 1) to angle


    3. Determine Patterns from certain nodes' combination


    4. So It can be Pattern Recognition of "Hand Signal"


    5. Output : The Pattern Number


    6. Back to the Pose Estimation Process
